reeltime - a sh(1) and gpioctl(1) based mechanical score reel clock

This started out as a simple test of what could be done with a barebones
FreeBSD/ARM installation on the RaspberryPi. It ended up getting stuffed
into a gutted 1970 Gottlieb "Baseball" backbox with a transformer from some
random fax machine and a opto-isolated relay bank. 

This was originally written for GNU/Linux, bash3, and WiringPi's 'gpio' binary. 
Said script was scrapped in favor of this "POSIX compliant" version. *cough*
Since the game is from the dawn of UNIX time, I decided to stick with an actual
UNIX descendant for nostalgia's sake.
